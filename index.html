			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I currantly am a high school sophmore at Gems World Acadamy</p>
			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
			<p>I enjoy a wide range of hobbies and am often exploring new ones to try! Some that I've done in the past and enjoyed were: gymnastics, dance, sketching, silks, etc. Even if I am not actively doing some of these activities, they're still ones that I've experimented with in the past and enjoyed. One of my passions is learning and speaking Spanish. I used to be fluent when I was younger but as I got older I lost. So know I am on a mission to be completely fluent in Spanish as I once was. Not only do my hobbies and passions vary, but so do my interests! I'd love volunteer/ intern/ work in professions that are very niche, to get a perspective from places one might not consider. For example, some of the professions I'd be interested in doing temporarily are working in an exotic pet shop, being involved in the behind the scenes of a circus. Like making props, doing performers makeup/ designs, taking care of the circus animals, selling tickets, or even opening the show! I'm also interested in working in a magicians shop/ magician's assistant, just for the experience and connections I might make. Since these interests are mainly just for fun and to meet new people, I might not pursue all of them while in my high school career, and would only be interested in internships that are directed to discovery and my own curiosity. Like working in a museum or aquarium.  </p>
